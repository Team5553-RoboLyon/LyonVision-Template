# LyonVision Template

A simple vision tracking format to use, create and deploy other programs with.

This template has to be used with the LyonVision raspberry pi image located at https://github.com/Team5553-RoboLyon/LyonVision-pi-gen

## Setting up a vision project

1. [Create a repository based on this template](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

2. Run `git submodule add https://github.com/Team5553-RoboLyon/LyonVision-Library src/lib` after cloning your new repo. This will init the [LyonVision-Library](https://github.com/Team5553-RoboLyon/LyonVision-Library) git submodule.

3. Remove this [README](README.md) and rename the [README_Generated-Repos.md](README_Generated-Repos.md) file to `README.md`.

4. Start programming your vision program : instructions are located in the [README_Generated-Repos.md](README_Generated-Repos.md) file.
